# MinecraftEpisodeMarkers
This is a datapack which adds episode markers as a feature in your Minecraft world.

## Use case
Episode markers come in handy during events that are recorded and are planned to be released in an episode format.

For example, the event could last 3 hours. Beforehand, all people recording the event came together and decided it would be nice if the event could be released simultaneously, using 15 minute episodes.

Instead of everyone needing separate timers, episode markers are a way to consistently time the length of the episodes and give a message in chat, a sound effect which plays, et cetera. This also aids the viewers of the videos in knowing when an episode is supposed to end.

## Features
* Starting, pausing, resuimg and resetting timer
* Fully configurable

## Installation
Installation goes like any other datapack:
 - Download the latest ZIP from the [releases](https://github.com/PhotonBursted/MinecraftEpisodeMarkers/releases) page
 - Go into your [local Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft) saves folder
 - Pick the save you want to put the datapack into and navigate into it
 - Navigate into the `datapacks` folder and place your ZIP into here
 - If the world was already opened while doing this, make sure to execute the `/reload` command or reopen your world for the changes to take effect.
